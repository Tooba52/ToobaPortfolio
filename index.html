    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Art Generator</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a understanding 
	of the use of methods, loops, and randomness. I created an random art generator in which it will produce one of my three designs randomly. The designs being circles, triangles and squares. Each time the program is laoded it will randomise the colours that appear giving you a unique design each time. Using keyPressed I have allowed it to manually change the colour of the a particular set of shapes independently from the rest using keys 1-8. These colours are also random however.

    <h3>Java Projects: Platformer Game</h3>
    <p>
      For this java project I created a platfomer game using Intellij. My game consists of my main character, 
      a cat which is controlled using a, w, d and shoots furballs at its enemies using space.
      These enemies are patrolling dogs. The goal of the game is to collect three fishes across each level while
      avoid touching the dogs, as they will make the cat lose lives. The amount fof ish collected and the amount of
      lives left are displayed at the top of the users screen. If the player loses all their lives a game
      over sequence is triggered. Each level has a new element added to it. During this projects I developed
      my understanding of graphical user interfaces and object orientated programming. I also worked with files.
      In my GUI I implemeted buttons: save, load, reset, volume. Difficulties that I faced during the project were
      finding sound effects, music and images that suited my game style so it all looked cohesive.
